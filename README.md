The vision for Vayu is to be THE platform for personal productivity.

To kick off development, I chose to start with a simple todos application that'll eventually grow into the vision that I have. There are of course many apps that already do this and they are really good, though there are issues like some are too simple, some focus on team work/project management and some others cater to specific aspects of day-to-day productivity.

**The Newton's apple question** - What will a productivity platform that requires the least possible learning effort, and with the ability to morph itself in context to provide the best utility/user experience possible look/work like?

The mission for Vayu is to be the answer to that question.
