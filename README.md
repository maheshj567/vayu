# Vayu
This is a simple to-do's application that I'm working on to experiment with Backbone.js and HTML5 LocalStorage

[See it in action](http://vayu.io:48389)

## Progress

### v0.3

* Changed name and hosting

### v0.2

* using JSON.stringify to encode data instead of manually building the string - fixes bugs related to JSON encoding
* edit board and card name
* Finished on 23 Nov, '13

### v0.1

* Cards are added to the list at the top (rather) than at the bottom
* Used require.js to create a modular application structure - separate views and models

### v0

* Add boards
* Add cards
* Add do-do's
* Reset everything
* Store data in LocalStorage
* Finished on 07 Oct, '12
