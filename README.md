# Do-do's
This is a simple to-do's application that I'm working on to experiment with Backbone.js and HTML5 LocalStorage

[See it in action](http://maheshj.com:48389)

## Progress

### v0.1

* Cards are added to the list at the top (rather) than at the bottom
* Used require.js to create a modular application structure - separate views and models

### v0

* Add boards
* Add cards
* Add do-do's
* Reset everything
* Store data in LocalStorage
* Finished on 07 Oct, '12
