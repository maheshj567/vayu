# Vayu

It started off a project to help myself understand Backbone.js. Now I'm working on making it into a full featured app. The roadmap is a little fuzzy right now. I'm just adding whatever features that are on my mind.

Got any ideas? Or just say hi? Get in touch [@maheshj567](http://twitter.com/maheshj567).

## Current feature set

1. Create boards
2. Edit board names
3. Create cards
4. Edit cards
5. Create/finish todo's
6. Stores all data in your browser's local storage. So it won't be deleted even when you refresh the web page

## Progress

### v0.3

* Changed name and hosting
* Changed logo

### v0.2

* using JSON.stringify to encode data instead of manually building the string - fixes bugs related to JSON encoding
* edit board and card name
* Finished on 23 Nov, '13

### v0.1

* Cards are added to the list at the top (rather) than at the bottom
* Used require.js to create a modular application structure - separate views and models

### v0

* Add boards
* Add cards
* Add todo's
* Reset everything
* Store data in LocalStorage
* Finished on 07 Oct, '12
